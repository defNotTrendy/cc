                </div>
			    <div class="panel margin-lr-7">
            		<p>Plastic Credit & Debit cards are clone from real cards transferred to blank (or embossed/printed with any name) chipped cards. These are best to use in retail shops or ATM machines. You will be provided with a PIN number which will be programmed before dispatching to you.</p>

                </div>
				<div class="panel margin-lr-7">
	        		 <p>Well, most intermediate carders know what balance transfers are but for you newbies I will explain. Due to more and more advanced security, most new carders find it difficult cashing out cards, PayPal accounts etc; this is why there are services called balance transfers. <br><br>How it works? <br>Pretty simple, contact us with the service you require, the amount you need to be transferred to your account, we will charge you a percentage (before the balance is transferred to you), we will give you a timeline, days later you receive your balance.<br><br> You're wondering why we don't do it ourselves, right?<br> Simple, we don't have the resources to keep opening new/fake accounts.</p>

                </div>
				<div class="panel margin-lr-7">
	        		 <p>Well we wouldn't consider expensive, we would call it premium service. Unlike other vendors we work on "Money Back Guaranteed" basis, this means our products have to be 100% working (or we will be losing money!). This is why we are a little more expensive than other vendors. Like the ol' sayin' you pay peanuts you get monkeys!</p>

                </div>
				<div class="panel margin-lr-7">
	        		 <p>Well, you may withdraw as much as the card provides, however you may only withdraw up to $300 a day as per the bank's policy. You card may be blocked as like all other transactions you may do, but we would recommend you to carry out ONE withdraw at 23:55 and another at 00:05. This way you just collected $600 in one go. If the card is not blocked by the following day you may do same thing again until the credit runs out. </p>

	        		 <p>Don't be so stupid! If we do that with EVERY customer we ship worldwide, the risk we're taking would not be worth the effort. Remember, we're runing a business not a charity. If you can't trust us simply DON'T order from us.</p>

	        		 <p>We make much more money working from 'home' peacefully rather than go out and risk to get caught. I'm not gonna lie, you CAN get caught if you're greedy. See below for some tips to reduce the risk of getting caught.</p>

				<div class="panel margin-lr-7">
	        		 <p>Yes, we use a couple of processes to get it done. If you supply us with your name we will print and emboss your name on the card. 
					 <br>PLEASE NOTE: This service is FREE of charge on purchases of ฿0.36 and over. For lower ammounts the charge is ฿0.06 to have the CC printed and embossed.</p>

                    <h4 class="post-title">How can I reduce the risk of getting caught?</h4>
            	</div>
			 	<div class="panel margin-lr-7">
	        		<p>You can use these tips. It will certainly reduce the risk of getting caught or risk of being identified.
					<br>Use in retail shops:
					<br>1- Avoid using big stores. Big stores may be loaded with CCTV.
					<br>2- Plan your route. Plan your route to the store and make sure the route you take is not covered with CCTV. Better even is to plan your route at least 5 days before you visit the store.
					<br>3- Dress casual. A pair of jeans, a jacket and a fashionable baseball cap will do just fine.
					<br>4- Make yourself bigger than you are. Last case scenario and IF there is an investigation (which I doubt very much) making your physical appearance different will make the investigation near impossible to identify you. Wear a few sweaters to make you fat, and a few jeans. Or if you're slim, why not dress as a woman for change?
					<br>5- No jewellery or tattoos. If you have any visible tattoos or wear any jewellery, cover it and remove the jewellery. If you don't have any anyway, get covered with them. :)
					<br>6- Throw away EVERYTHING you wore on the day. That's right, make sure you're wearing something inexpensive so you can throw away or even burn everything you were wearing on the day.
					<br>7- Covering your fingerprints (optional). If you want to go and extra mile to hide your identity, grab some transparent tap and stick on your fingertips, make sure your fingerprints of every finger is covered. Don't wear gloves! Is too obvious! Unless if extremely cold where you live.
					<br>
					<br>Use in ATM machines:
					<br>1- Plan your route. Plan your route to the ATM machine and make sure the route you take is not covered with CCTV. Take a mask with you, when you're approaching the ATM put the mask on. Some ATM machines may have cameras inside.
					<br>2- Wear winter gloves. If its summer, cut the fingers of a latex gloves and wear them. All you need is the fingerprints to be covered.</p>

                </div>
				<div class="panel margin-lr-7">
	        		 <p>Bitcoins are very straight forward. You will need a wallet, either on your phone, online or even on your tablet. On your phone just search under "Bitcoin wallet" and you will see various apps to download free of charge. When you download the app you will be given a unique wallet address. Now to get bitcoins you can buy them pretty much anywhere online, we suggest <a target="_blank" href="https://www.coinbase.com"><font color="white">Coinbase.com</font></a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://bitbargain.com"><font color="white">Bitbargain.com</font></a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://localbitcoins.com"><font color="white">LocalBitcoins.com</font></a>. Once registered, you begin the purchase of your bitcoins. Initiate a transaction with the seller by follwing the steps on the website, the seller will ask you for your wallet address which is the one from your phone's bitcoin app, seller will transfer the bitcoins to you and once you receive them you release the payment to the seller. Now you have your bitcoins in your phone.
					 <br>
					 <br> Remember: The bitcoins is on your phone and your phone only, if you lose your phone you will lose your bitcoins!</p>

Also, unlike other machines in general which needs to be connected to an actual database in order to store data, our readers stores the data onto .dat files, saving time when the reader reads the card and stores it instantly in a blink of an eye.<br> Lets compare it, see below:<br>
					<br><strong>-If the machine stores data on a database</strong>
					<br>Reader reads card > reader contacts database > if database connection successful > data is stored
