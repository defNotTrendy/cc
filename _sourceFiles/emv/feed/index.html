				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the implementation of EMV chip cards, we’ve seen card-present fraud decrease significantly – a major win for both merchants and consumers. But we know that doesn’t mean that all fraud is gone. Recent trends indicate that one type of fraud in particular is on the rise: friendly fraud.</p>
<p>What is friendly fraud? In short, friendly fraud occurs when a cardholder makes a real purchase, receives the goods, and then purposely disputes the charge in order to be refunded. Essentially, it’s glorified stealing.</p>
<p>So what’s causing this increase in (not so) friendly fraud, and more importantly, how can merchants fight back against it?</p>
<h5><strong>The growth of friendly fraud</strong></h5>
<p>Friendly fraud charges have been occurring more and more recently, often for two reasons. First, it’s easier than ever for customers to dispute charges (often, it just takes one tap on a mobile banking app). Second, it’s becoming more difficult and costly for merchants to contest chargebacks or prove transaction’s legitimacy.</p>
<p>Many merchants find the burden of proof too cumbersome, and therefore avoid fighting back against chargebacks altogether. Crucial steps to preventing chargebacks include: having and displaying clear return policies, using clear business names on customers’ credit card statements, and always providing accurate information about your items and services. But even if these actions are taken, it ensures merchants impenetrable against this type of fraud. For example, take the EMV changeover nearly two years ago. As the confusion about liability became chaotic, opportunistic fraudsters stumbled upon the viability of friendly fraud. Since then, they’ve continued to push and explore this method.</p>
<h5><strong>Arming yourself against it</strong></h5>
<p>As fraud evolves, merchants need to as well. In order to fight back against friendly fraud, there are three crucial steps merchants should look to implement to help significantly reduce their risk:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Implement EMV.</strong> Today, being EMV compatible is basically table stakes. EMV has transformed fraud as we knew it, but those who don’t use EMV have shouldered a huge additional liability burden—one which many didn’t realize was coming. Every store should accept EMV.</li>
<li><strong>Use the best available online verification</strong>. Many merchants think that simply using an address verification (AVS) or CVV will stop ecommerce fraud. But criminals have evolved, and you need to be sure you have more extensive measures in place, such as:
<ul>
<li>Implement a predictive, customizable risk analysis technology, like <a href="https://www.kount.com/">Kount</a>, into your e-commerce business OR</li>
<li>Develop a customizable rule set to predict fraudulent transactions before they happen.</li>
<li>Make sure you have a fraud strategy in place. Small to medium sized businesses tend to implement a cheap solution (set it and forget it). Fraud systems need to be re-examined at least once a quarter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Make sure you’re keeping the best records possible</strong>. Clear, organized and thorough record-keeping is incredibly important to reducing chargebacks and disputed transactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The payment landscape is constantly evolving. New technologies are introduced at a rapid pace, the fraudster population is growing, and merchants constantly need to adapt and evolve to mitigate their risk. While fraud may likely never be eradicated completely, there are key steps merchants can take to best protect themselves against friendly fraud, bringing them one step closer to protecting themselves, their customers, and their bottom line.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MACHINE reading is not a modern or originative conception.</p>
<p>Skimming admit criminals to take away the data from the geophysics belt on entry and MACHINE playing-card so they buoy extra playing-card to abandon the victims’ deposit give via notes backdowns or big obtain, each previously the deposit or the client make happen it and deactivates the carte.</p>
<p>With EMV (Europay, Mastercard &amp; Visa) maturing many extensively recognised and accepted, it was false this issue would grow dim. The shard-authorized playing-card offer cryptography and tokenization that is bey the means of criminals to breakage. On the other hand creative malefactors desire unrelentingly search into organizations, processes and humans until they obtain a vulnerability or an chance. That vulnerability is the attractive fillet that yet survives on each EMV playing-card.<br />
When a bend location a boater on an MACHINE, fuel spot, restaraunt, or additional spot-of-traffic mechanism, he&#8217;s yet capable to imitation the attractive strip’s information whether the implement assumes the full carte.</p>
<p>This intend that nearly ATMs, or anyplace a carte is swiped as the trader doesn’t aid EMV, let hacks accession to the easy to frustration magnetized slip, all the more whether the carte itself is EMV.</p>
<p>Once criminals get derived the attractive airfield, they desire parallel the carte without the EMV microchip. And, whether the MACHINE or spot-of-trading design criminals apply to shoplift capital from is not EMV amenable, the proprietor of the non-EMV contrivance buoy be held apt representing the release attracted. This is as EMV authorized ATMs or POS terminals are programmed to eliminate EMV playing-card that are swiped as the apparatus is envisaging a sherd.</p>
<p>For assemblies with gift gear, each is not missed. It is value excavation with your MACHINE servicing supplier or credence carte c.p.u. to figure in occupation regulation to break cloned EMV playing-card from entrancing work of your gift gear.<br />
For example, during POS negotiation where a client lash out at a carte distinguished as EMV, it strength be potential to get the terminating represent the client with a substance to manus the carte to the storehouse worker. Staff member could so be disciplined to bear witness to the carte has an EMV crisp.</p>
<p>And representing ATMs, diminishing the measure of capital that buoy be reserved from non-EMV-amenable terminals causes it many hard representing poor boys to buy.</p>
<p>The better solvent, nevertheless, is to inaugurate EMV gear and guy sharp representing the following wrinkle in the poor guys’ playbook.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since the EMV liability shift in October 2015, the way people pay for items on a daily basis has changed a lot. Now, chip-and-PIN transactions are the norm and most people use the relatively new payment platform regularly, thanks to a heavy push from both card issuers and retailers. More than two years since that liability shift went into effect, it’s important for businesses at all points in the payments ecosystem to consider what’s different, and what’s next.</p>
<p>For instance, fewer than 10 percent of all payments in the U.S. used EMV before the shift went into effect, but today, nearly every credit card in circulation has a microchip embedded in it, according to new research from the Auriemma Consulting Group. That, in turn, has reduced the amount of fraud for all major card issuers – both in the real world and for e-commerce transactions – by 23 percent since the start of 2015.</p>
<p>Furthermore, claims of fraud from counterfeit credit cards have fallen in each of the past five quarters and is now down 34 percent from the all-time high observed at the start of 2016, just after the liability shift.</p>
<p>A Broader Rollout</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it’s important to note that while the EMV shift for most merchants began two years ago, it’s still coming for other types of businesses, according to NACS Online. For instance, gas stations and other businesses with card readers outside won’t have to comply with EMV standards until 2020, but experts say it’s vital for them to get out in front of the issue, and also work on addressing other types of payment security standards.</p>
<p>“Now is not the time to take your foot off the gas with regard to EMV,” Linda Toth, director of standards at Conexxus, said at a recent NACS conference, “2020 will be here before you know it. [EMV] Is one layer of a multi-layer approach to securing card data and being EMV capable does not mean you are PCI compliant.” Regardless if the deadline is a few years away, owners of gas stations need to be working towards EMV compliance as it will be a lengthy and expensive process. Not doing so is essentially opening the door to fraudsters and data thieves who are targeting these establishments.</p>
<p>Recommended for You</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fraud has been reduced at the point-of-sale by double digit percentages. It is clear that chip technology is working. From their peak in 2016, counterfeit claims have declined consecutive quarters. As EMV compliance increases, the risk of counterfeit cards will continue to decline. EMV technology has tokenization and point-to-point encryption, which stomp out fraudulent access.</p>
<p>Now that EMV has been such a success, the card brand companies are doing away with signatures. This includes MasterCard, Visa, Discover, and American Express starting April of this year. Not only will this make the process more efficient but it also highlights just how safe chip card transactions are. According to Linda Kilpatrick, the Vice President of MasterCard’s U.S. Market Development Division, “You may have noticed that you won’t have to sign when buying a cup of coffee or a train ticket, but will have to sign when buying a new pair of sneakers. With the advent of new security, we can create a more consistent shopping experience that excludes signature.” For small sales where fraud is least likely to occur, signatures will eventually be completely done away with, as they are unnecessary with the improved EMV security.</p>
<p>Card Issuers Are Ready</p>
<p>When the liability shift was first announced, card issuers moved quickly to stockpile EMV-enabled cards for later issuance, according to Payments Source. The security provided by EMV cards – which are generally issued for five years and don’t need to be replaced nearly as often as fraud continues to decline – are pushing back orders from banks that used to be far more frequent. Experts say that now, it may not be until 2020 or 2021 when financial institutions start buying cards en masse once again.</p>
<p>But with this in mind, experts further note the stockpiles could actually provide an opportunity for card manufacturers to start tinkering with new types of security features that go above and beyond extant EMV standards and are more future-facing, as a means of addressing what could be emerging threats, the report said. Especially now that the card brands are doing away with signatures, there is even more incentive to get chip cards into the hands of every single consumer.</p>
<p>In the meantime, merchants should be fully invested in EMV, and if they aren’t yet, taking a look at the available options for handling these transactions will only serve to make them more attractive to shoppers who have, by and large, grown accustomed to using EMV for their everyday purchases.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US marketplace was 25 age ass the period as it couples to sliver-supported playing-card, mainly as of the force of prognostic grading and the price of the emv transition.
